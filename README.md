# Train-Railways-Alarm-System-Project-with-ESP32-CAM
*This is my project for the second communications engineering year. throughout this article I'll walk you through the system and the components and how they work together.*

## The components used:
- 3 Ultrasonic sensors
- 2 Hall Effect sensors
- 2 Servo motors
- 2 Servo Linear Actuator (3d printed)
- ESP32-CAM Board
- FTDI Module
- LDR sensor
- LEDs & Buzzers
- Magnets
- Working Mechanism (the system)
